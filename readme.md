<b>Detailed Analysis</b>

A detailed analysis of this problem domain would involve researching the current ticketing process and identifying the pain points for users. This includes understanding the typical user journey, such as how users currently search for and purchase tickets, and the challenges they face. It could also include researching the competition and understanding how other ticketing websites operate, as well as understanding the target audience and their needs and preferences.
It would also include a technical study, research on the market, user’s needs and the competition, as well as a feasibility study of the proposed solution and the budget that would be required for the project.

<b>Purpose and Need of the Project</b>

• The core problem that our application aims to solve is inconvenience and time-consumption of purchasing the tickets of different events from separate websites.

• Our application aims to make the process of purchasing tickets more convenient by allowing users to purchase tickets, read reviews and ratings, search for all kinds of events (movies, concerts, sports) – all in one single application. No all-in-one application is found in Canada to cater all customer needs.

• Existing Applications have this problem that user must create different accounts and payment credentials for each site to be used limiting the user experience and safety.

• Existing event booking systems have been designed for user-by-user basis (who know how to use them and already have an idea of what they want) but what about those who don’t?

• There are no solutions available in the market which allows users to book the tickets for events while recommending the available transportation mode while suggesting the cost.
